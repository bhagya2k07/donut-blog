cd donut-delights

Just open index.html in any modern browser.

3️⃣ Deploy on GitHub Pages

Commit & push to a public repository.

Rename donut-blog.html to index.html so GitHub Pages serves it as the homepage.

Your site will be live at https://<your-username>.github.io/donut-delights/.

Made with ❤️ and plenty of 🍩
### Tips
- Be sure to **rename** `donut-blog.html` → `index.html` before pushing to GitHub Pages; it’s required so the site loads at the root URL.
- If you later add images or other assets, create an `assets/` folder and update paths accordingly.
